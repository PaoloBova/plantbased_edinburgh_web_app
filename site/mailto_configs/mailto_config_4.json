    "later_paragraphs": [
      "Public health research shows that plant-based diets are associated with lower rates of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. The National Food Strategy has recommended that food served in the public sector should be plant-based by default.",
      "From an environmental perspective, plant-based foods have substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to animal products. They also use less agricultural land and freshwater resources.",
      "Edinburgh has committed to ambitious climate targets and has endorsed policies recognizing the importance of sustainable food systems. Changing council catering would be a concrete implementation of these commitments.",
      "Edinburgh has a thriving plant-based food scene, with restaurants and caterers offering varied and high-quality menus. The council would have good local options for sourcing plant-based catering. I would encourage you to support this proposal when it comes back to council."
