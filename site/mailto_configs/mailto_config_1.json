    "opening_paragraph": "I am writing to you as one of your constituents regarding the plant-based catering decision that will come before the council in March 2026 when the report has been finalised. I wanted to share my perspective on why I support this transition.",
    "later_paragraphs": [
      "Edinburgh has set ambitious climate targets, including Net Zero by 2030. The food system contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, and research shows that plant-based foods generally have a much lower carbon footprint than animal products. Switching council catering would be a practical step towards meeting these commitments.",
      "Several UK councils have already made this transition, including Oxfordshire County Council, Cambridge City Council, and Exeter City Council. With Edinburgh's growing plant-based food sector, this makes the transition particularly feasible for council catering."
