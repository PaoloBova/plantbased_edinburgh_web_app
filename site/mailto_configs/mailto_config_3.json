    "greeting": "Dear Councillor",
    "opening_paragraph": "I am writing regarding the proposal to switch council catering to 100% plant-based food. As one of your constituents, I wanted to explain why I believe this aligns with Edinburgh's existing climate policies.",
    "later_paragraphs": [
      "In 2023, Edinburgh became the first European capital to endorse the Plant Based Treaty, recognizing the connection between food systems and climate change. However, the council's action plan explicitly stated it would not change the council's own catering practices.",
      "This seems inconsistent with the spirit of the treaty endorsement. If we acknowledge that food systems need to change to address climate breakdown, the council could lead by example through its own catering.",
      "The proposal is limited to council meetings and internal events, not city-wide policy. This is a manageable scope that other councils have implemented successfully.",
      "I hope you will support this measure once the report is finalised in March 2026."
