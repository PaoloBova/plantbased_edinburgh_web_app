    "later_paragraphs": [
      "Edinburgh was the first European capital to endorse the Plant Based Treaty. This showed forward thinking on the connection between food systems and climate change. Changing the council's own catering would be a logical follow-up to that endorsement.",
      "Climate science is clear that reducing consumption of animal products is necessary to meet emissions targets. While individual dietary choices remain personal, public institutions can make decisions about what they serve at their own events.",
      "Councils including Oxfordshire, Cambridge, and Exeter have already adopted plant-based catering policies. These councils report that plant-based menus can be both varied and well-received when properly planned. Edinburgh could join them in taking this practical step towards climate action.",
