      "Research from Oxford University has found that plant-based diets are not only more sustainable but can also be more cost-effective than conventional diets.",
      "Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to climate change, deforestation, and biodiversity loss. Plant-based foods require substantially less land, water, and energy to produce.",
      "Given Edinburgh's Net Zero 2030 target, I believe the council should consider all available opportunities to reduce emissions, including changes to catering practices.",
      "Edinburgh has a strong plant-based food culture, from established restaurants to catering businesses. The council would be well-positioned to source high-quality, varied plant-based menus locally."
